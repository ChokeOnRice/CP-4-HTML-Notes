			<h1>CP-4 HTML Notes</h1>
			<p>
				Identify as HTML: <!DOCTYPE html>
				Everything has an opening and closing bracket, closing bracket having a /<br />
				< h e a d > Holds the metadata<br />
				< t i t l e > Holds the title of the website --> what you see on the tab<br />
				Between < p > < / p >, there would be a paragraph<br />
				Within the < p >, you can place a < b r  / > which is a line break that skips a line for you. This is an example of a self-closing tag
				< b o d y > contains the writing and the images
				Indentation is an important aspect within HTML which allows the program to understand what is being written
				< h 1 > is the title, with < h 2 >, < h 3 >, < h 4 >, etc. are sub-headers
				< d i v > Used for dividing the text, while < s p a n > is used for shorter pieces of text
